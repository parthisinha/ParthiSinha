## About Me :)

✨ Hi, I'm Parthi!

🎓 I’m a high schooler exploring the world of coding and tech — always building, learning, and experimenting with fun ideas.

🐍 I code mostly in Python 

🛠️ I am working on various projects right now.

🚀 I’m learning more every day with the goal of becoming a Developer.

🌱 Currently exploring:
- Game development with Pygame
- Automation scripts
- Web design with HTML & CSS

💼 Always up for:
- Remote internships
- Contributing to open-source
- Learning from awesome devs in the community

🎮 Outside of coding, I enjoy:
- Cooking up new recipes 🍳  
- Playing games 
- Talking about random stuff — tech, life, or just chilling 😄
